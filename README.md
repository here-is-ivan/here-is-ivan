## About Me

ðŸŽ¯ **Fun fact:** I started coding when I was 12 after being inspired by the movie "Jobs" just to learn a couple of years later that Steve Jobs didn't write a single line of code for Apple<br/>
ðŸŽª **Random skill:** My average touch typing speed is about 70 wpm and I'm trying to get it to 100<br/>
âš¡ **Superpower:** If I could have any superpower, it would be immortality so I can finally have enough time to learn C++<br/>
ðŸ¤« **Guilty pleasure:** I secretly solve LeetCode while no one is watching<br/>
ðŸ”¥ **Unpopular opinion:** Bloodborne and Dark Souls are actually not that hard if you enjoy learning
